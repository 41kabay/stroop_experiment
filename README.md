# Stroop Task for Bilingual Participants

This is a cognitive psychology experiment based on the **Stroop Task**, implemented in Python using [PsychoPy](https://psychopy.org/). It is designed to assess cognitive control in **bilingual participants**, by comparing reaction times and accuracy across two language blocks: native and second language.

## üß† Description

Participants will see **color words** displayed in various colors. Their task is to respond:

- **Press ‚Üí (Right Arrow)** if the **word meaning matches** the color of the text (**congruent**).
- **Press ‚Üê (Left Arrow)** if the **word meaning does not match** the color of the text (**incongruent**).

The experiment:
- Supports bilingual comparison (native vs. second language)
- Provides **Russian, Spanish, Turkish** as native languages (English is always the second language)
- Measures **reaction time** and **accuracy**
- Saves the results in `stroop_results.csv` (UTF-8 encoded)
